# Exact Diagonalization

Source code for exact digonalization of spin-1/2 Hamiltonians. 

One can easily construct a Hamiltonian within translational invariance/U(1)/Z2 subspace.

The package currently requires [TBB](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB), [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), and [ARPACK-NG](https://github.com/opencollab/arpack-ng/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt).

See [tfi_arpack.cpp](examples/tfi_arpack.cpp) for an example.
